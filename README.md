# companion4me

A social media android app where lonely people can find other people that need a friend. Developed in Java, PHP and MySQL.

This was a university group project and the app's server host is not working anymore (since it was free for a limited time). However, you can watch a screencast of when the app was fully working.

The app server files are included in the folder "serverFiles" writen in PHP.

A youtube video of the working app is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q2PaOFaTTk
